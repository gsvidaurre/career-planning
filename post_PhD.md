Postdoctoral positions after completing a PhD
========================================================

What are postdocs? 

- Jobs focused on learning new skills and progressing your career
- Focus on learning depends on the type of postdoc
- Postdocs may or may not be necessary depending on your career goals
  - Tenure-track positions require postdoc experience
  - Alternative academic and non-academic jobs usually do not
  
Diverse types of postdoc positions
========================================================

- Competitive fellowships
  - Government, research institutes or foundations, universities
  - Basic science, applied research, industry, teaching or outreach focused
  - More flexibility in research projects, mentors and institutions, skills to learn
  
- Job postings 
  - More often through universities and research institutes
  - Less flexibility in research projects and mentor(s), as well as your own learning and research independence
    - More likely to work on a project that was already designed, using methods in which you're an expert

Deciding whether to do a postdoc
========================================================

- What career track are you interested in?
- What skills would you be interested in learning as a postdoc?
  - Research, teaching, mentorship, soft skills
- Do you have limitations on where you can or want to live and work?
  - Family responsibilities, healthcare considerations, financial obstacles
  - Immigrant status, safety considerations for people of color and other groups that have long faced discrimination  

Possible pros of postdoc positions
========================================================
- Opportunities to learn new skills and work in different systems
- Broaden your professional networks
  - Mentoring, collaboration, peer support networks
- More research independence than PhD experience
  - Can depend on the type of position and your mentor
- Learn more about different research groups
  - Labs tend to have very different research and mentoring structures, as well as expectations
  - Can be refreshing and informative to see how research is done elsewhere
- Remote postdocs are becoming more common
  - Offset costs and stress associated with moving

Possible cons of postdoc positions
========================================================
- Not all careers require or will benefit from postdoc experience
- Temporary position, job certainty may last only a year or less 
  - Postdoc positions of 1 - 2 years are common
  - Often will need to start searching for next position a year before your current position ends
- May need to move great distances for postdoc position
- Multiple postdoc jobs can mean multiple cross-country moves
- Doing more than one postdoc can place you further down the academic career track
  - May be more work to pitch transferrable skills for non-academic careers
