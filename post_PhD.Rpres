Deciding whether to do a postdoc
========================================================

- What career track are you interested in?
- What skills would you be interested in learning as a postdoc?
  - Research, teaching, mentorship, soft skills
- Do you have limitations on where you can or want to live and work?
  - Family responsibilities, healthcare considerations, financial obstacles, immigrant status, safety considerations for people of color and other groups that have historically faced great discrimination  

Pros and cons of postdoc positions
========================================================
- Opportunities to learn new skills and work in different systems from PhD research
- Opportunities to broaden mentoring network, collaborative network, and other professional connections
- More research independence than PhD experience
  - Can depend on the type of position and your mentor
- But not all careers require or will benefit from postdoc experience
- Temporary position, job certainty can last only a year or less (need to start searching for next position a year beforehand)
- Will likely need to move great distances for postdoc position
- Multiple postdoc jobs can mean multiple cross-country moves
